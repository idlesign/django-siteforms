Description
-----------

*Django reusable app to simplify form construction*

For those who consider maintaining templates-based forms solutions for Django a burden.

Features:

* Full form rendering support, including prolog and submit button
* Subforms support (represent entire other form as form field)
* Field groups
* Declarative attributes for elements
* Simplified declarative forms layout, allowing fields ordering
* Aria-friendly (Accessible Rich Internet Applications)

Supported styling:

* No CSS
* Bootstrap 4


Usage
-----

To render a form in templates just address a variable, e.g. ``<div>{{ form }}</div>``.

.. note:: By default there's no need to add a submit button and wrap it all into ``<form>``.

Basic
~~~~~

Let's show how to build a simple form.

.. code-block:: python

    from django.shortcuts import render
    from siteforms.composers.bootstrap4 import Bootstrap4
    from siteforms.toolbox import ModelForm


    class MyForm(ModelForm):
        """This form will show us how siteforms works."""
        
        disabled_fields = {'somefield'}  # One way of disabling fields.
        hidden_fields = {'otherfield'}  # One way of hiding fields.

        class Composer(Bootstrap4):
            """This will instruct siteforms to compose this
            form using Bootstrap 4 styling.

            """
        class Meta:
            model = MyModel  # Suppose you have a model class already.
            fields = '__all__'

    def my_view(request):
        # Initialize form using data from POST.
        my_form = MyForm(request=request, src='POST')
        is_valid = form.is_valid()
        return render(request, 'mytemplate.html', {'form': my_form})


Composer options
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now let's see how to tune our form.

.. code-block:: python

    from siteforms.composers.bootstrap4 import Bootstrap4, FORM, ALL_FIELDS

    class Composer(Bootstrap4):

        opt_size='sm',  # Bootstrap 4 has sizes, so let's make our form small.

        # Element (fields, groups, form, etc.) attributes are ruled by `attrs`.
        # Let's add rows=2 to our `contents` model field.
        attrs={'contents': {'rows': 2}},

        # To group fields into named groups describe them in `groups`.
        groups={
            'basic': 'Basic attributes',
            'other': 'Other fields',
        },

        # We apply custom layout to our form.
        layout = {
            FORM: {
                'basic': [  # First we place `basic` group.
                    ['title', 'date_created'],  # These two fields go into a row.
                    'contents',  # This one field goes into a separate row.
                ],
                # We place all the rest fields into `other` group.
                'other': ALL_FIELDS,
            }
        }
